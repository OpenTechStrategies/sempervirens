# Server-side thoughts:

# As of May 2015, Mozilla is handling peaks of ~1.8e6 pings/hour (= ~500
# requests/second on average over that hour), with ~31 GiB data received
# during that hour. Which is. Umm. A lot. (That's ~18 KiB/ping.)

# more stats stuff:

#
# Their server code:
#   https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-server
#   https://github.com/mozilla/telemetry-server/blob/master/http/server.js
# they reject any POST without content-length, they have a max data length
# they'll accept (and if something exceeds this they respond with a 202 so it
# won't get resent), they actual pings into files that get rotated at max size
# or max time, and they log some metadata about each request (url, bytes
# written, etc.) to a separate file... the main data file is in a fixed-width
# int binary format. They spawn 1 single-threaded node.js server per CPU on a
# server.
#
# Not sure how to do storage -- would rather not just write to a single frail
# disk really. Could dump directly into cloud files? But they are not designed
# for high write rates -- each container (= "bucket") is limited to 100 object
# write requests / second, and they say "You canâ€™t expect to write to the same
# object 20 times per second" -- http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/best-practices-for-using-cloud-files
# s3 appears to be more scalable to high-write workloads:
#   https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/request-rate-perf-considerations.html
# Neither allow appends, though -- just creation of new objects.
# On Amazon, SimpleDB is one approach.
#    https://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/
#    -- see "Logging" section
# Postgres could also work -- they do high-throughput transaction batching (so
# one fsync for many transactions) since 9.2.
# dropping into kafka I guess does allow to tee to both disk and some realtime
# analytics aggregation
# it does sound like kafka is pretty much the tool that's designed to deal
# with this problem. but even kafka expires data based on time, not whether
# it's been processed.
#
# could batch up writes to cloud storage -- once every 30 s or whatever.
# how durable is block storage?
#   "customers are strongly encouraged to implement a RAID level 1 (mirror)
#   configuration across multiple volumes to protect against data loss in the
#   event of a storage node failure."
# so that makes sense I guess.
# we could mount 2-3 block devices in RAID-1, stream stuff out to them
# append-style, and have a thread in the background that just fsync's
# continuously, and we don't reply success until after the next fsync has
# completed.
#   $0.12/GB/month, min 75 GB
#     -> $9/mo for the cheapest block device
#
# other storage options?
# - mongodb: no. https://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb
# - could just forward data to 3 more http servers each of whom write it to
#   disk
#
# aggregation:
# - for each time period, number of opt-outs vs. number of opt-ins -> ratio
# - let's put opt-in period into the opt-in metadata, to make this easily
#   available for imputation without having to keep records on ever installid
# - for each project, all (TLD, installid) pairs
#   - and counts of these uniques by TLD for different time periods
# - for each
#
# I guess we'll use aiohttp, with something like:
#   16 bytes magic
# then for each record:
#   u4 + string: ip address (could be ipv6)
#   ?? u4 + string: dns name
#   u4 + string: url
#   u8: time_t
#   u4 + string: the json payload (unvalidated)
# and then roll over the log every day or so. Or for opt-outs,
#   16 bytes magic
# then for each record:
#   ?? u4 + string: ip address
#   ?? u4 + string: dns name
#   u4 + string: url
#   u8: time_t
#   u4 + string: the json payload (unvalidated)
